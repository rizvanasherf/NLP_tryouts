# Sentiment Analysis with NLP using Multinomial Naive Bayes

This project performs sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. The dataset contains both positive and negative comments, and the goal is to classify each review as either positive or negative.

## Project Overview

- **Goal**: Classify IMDB reviews as positive or negative.
- **Approach**:  
  - Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.).  
  - Feature extraction using techniques like **TF-IDF** or **Count Vectorization**.  
  - Classification using **Multinomial Naive Bayes**.  

---

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of IMDB reviews with two categories:  
- **Positive reviews**  
- **Negative reviews**  

You can find the dataset [here](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) or in the repository if included.

## Code Explanation

### Key Steps in the Code:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Cleaning the text  
   - Tokenization  
   - Removing stopwords  
2. **Feature Extraction**:  
   - Converting text to numerical features using **CountVectorizer** or **TfidfVectorizer**  
3. **Model Training**:  
   - Using **Multinomial Naive Bayes** for classification  
4. **Model Evaluation**:  
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
